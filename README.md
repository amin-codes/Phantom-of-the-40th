# Phantom-of-the-40th
In honor of the 40th anniversary of the North Carolina Technology Student Association, we submitted this game for the Video Game Design event. This game helped us take 2nd in the state for the event. We made this game in an impressive span of four days.

We made this game with the help of a paid version of RPG Maker MV, which can be found at https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/#rpg-maker-mv
